# LilyGo T-Display S3 AMOLED (1.91")

Part of [Claude Usage Stick](../README.md). The AMOLED variant of the T-Display S3 — a long, narrow 240×536 RM67162 panel. One build covers every 1.91" revision: the panel variant (H712 / H713 / H705 / H681 / H717) is auto-detected at runtime by the LilyGo_AMOLED library, touch and non-touch, V1.0/V2.0/Black Shell alike.

## Controls

| ----- | ------- | --------- | --------- |
| Physical button (GPIO 0) | Button A | Cycle the current digit | Cycle brightness |
| Tap the screen anywhere | Button B | Confirm digit | Force refresh |

## Notes

- **Button B requires touch** — on non-touch variants (H712 / H713) there is no Button B input, so the touch-equipped revisions are the better pick.
- During setup, the WiFi AP password is shown on the device screen.
