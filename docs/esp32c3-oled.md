# ESP32-C3-OLED

Part of [Claude Usage Stick](../README.md). The smallest and cheapest way to run the firmware — a breadboard-friendly ESP32-C3 module with a 0.42" OLED. It has no built-in buttons, so you bring your own (two tactile buttons or capacitive touch pads).

## Flash

```bash
pio run -e esp32c3-oled -t upload     # firmware
pio run -e esp32c3-oled -t uploadfs   # web setup UI (SPIFFS)
```

## Wiring

The firmware expects both button inputs to be **active-HIGH** (HIGH = pressed, LOW = idle) with internal pull-downs enabled.

| Signal | GPIO | Notes |
| ------ | ---- | ----- |
| Button A (cycle brightness / cycle digit) | GPIO 3 | active-HIGH |
| Button B (force refresh / confirm digit) | GPIO 7 | active-HIGH |
| I²C SDA | GPIO 5 | display (built-in) |
| I²C SCL | GPIO 6 | display (built-in) |
| Onboard LED | GPIO 8 | active-LOW (HIGH = off) |

> **Do not wire anything to GPIO 9 (BOOT/BOOT0)** — it is a strapping pin used for download mode.

### Option A — tactile push-buttons

Wire each button between the GPIO pin and 3.3 V. When the button is open the internal pull-down holds the pin LOW; pressing it pulls it HIGH.

```
3.3 V ──┤button├── GPIO 3   (Button A)
3.3 V ──┤button├── GPIO 7   (Button B)
```

### Option B — capacitive touch sensors

Any module that outputs a logic-HIGH signal when touched works as a drop-in replacement (e.g. TTP223-based pads). Wire the sensor's output to the GPIO pin and its power pins to 3.3 V and GND. The signal polarity and pull-down behaviour are identical to Option A.

## Controls

| Context | Button A | Button B |
| ------- | -------- | -------- |
| PIN entry | Cycle the current digit (0–9) | Confirm digit, move to the next |
| Dashboard | Toggle display on/off | Force an immediate refresh |
| On boot | Hold **A+B** = factory reset (wipes all stored data) | |

## Notes

- During setup, a simple 8-digit WiFi AP password is shown on the OLED (`Pass:` line) — the tiny screen can't fit the full random password used by LCD boards.
- Brightness control is a simple on/off toggle (the 72×40 OLED has no meaningful brightness steps).
