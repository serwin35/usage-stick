# Elecrow CrowPanel Advance 3.5" HMI

Part of [Claude Usage Stick](../README.md). The biggest screen in the lineup — a 3.5" 480×320 IPS HMI panel with capacitive touch and no physical buttons. Pin mapping comes from Elecrow's official LovyanGFX driver and is verified on hardware.

## Flash

```bash
pio run -e crowpanel-adv-35 -t upload     # firmware
pio run -e crowpanel-adv-35 -t uploadfs   # web setup UI (SPIFFS)
```

## Controls — touch zones

There are no physical user buttons, so the two-button UX maps to halves of the touch panel (matching the on-screen "tap left / tap right" legend):

| Touch | Acts as | PIN entry | Dashboard |
| ----- | ------- | --------- | --------- |
| Tap **LEFT** half | Button A | Cycle the current digit | Cycle brightness |
| Tap **RIGHT** half | Button B | Confirm digit | Force refresh |

## Notes

- **No on-boot factory reset** — the A+B combo needs two simultaneous inputs and only a single touch point is read. Re-flash to wipe NVS.
- **No battery readout** — battery percentage isn't shown on the dashboard.
- The dashboard renders into a PSRAM sprite and is pushed in one transfer, so refreshes don't flicker on this slow SPI panel; the PIN/setup screens draw straight to the panel so touch input stays responsive.
- During setup, the WiFi AP password is shown on the device screen.
